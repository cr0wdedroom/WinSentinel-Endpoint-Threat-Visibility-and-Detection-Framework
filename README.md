# WinSentinel-Endpoint-Threat-Visibility-and-Detection-Framework

WinSentinel is a security monitoring framework that integrates modern Windows telemetry tools to provide real-time visibility, detection, and investigation capabilities for endpoint threats in a simulated enterprise environment.
This project demonstrates applied SOC Analyst skills by combining Sysmon, Sysinternals, Windows Event Logs, Osquery, and Wazuh SIEM to monitor, log, detect, and alert on suspicious activity across a Windows 11 VM — with Kali Linux used for simulating attacker behavior.

🛡️Project Objectives:

Build a robust endpoint logging and detection lab

Simulate real-world attacker behavior (recon, persistence, privilege escalation)

Detect anomalies using custom Sysmon rules, Osquery packs, and Wazuh alerts

Showcase core SOC skills: event correlation, telemetry analysis, and alert triage
